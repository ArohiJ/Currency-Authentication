# Currency-Authentication
A python application to detect whether the given bank note is counterfeit or real. 

Problem Statement 
Developing an application that will determine whether the given banknotes are counterfeit or legitimate based on the data set put together. This project is implemented using concepts of data science and machine learning algorithms in real time and analysing and implementing the same using Python language.  

Outcomes
Analyse and understand the technological needs to support tools and develop an application which will determine the authenticity of the given banknotes (currency). This project will establish if there exists a corelation between the attributes and plots graphs depicting the same. The data model built will be optimized to achieve maximum accuracy.
